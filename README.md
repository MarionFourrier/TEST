## TEST
Testing Git for the first time

Making my first steps on Github, I created this repo in order to try the plateform and to train myself with my firsts commits. 

# Language = python 3.10
# What = function that indicates how you should dress according to the weather
# Files = - 1 main that tests the function 
          - 1 module with the function
